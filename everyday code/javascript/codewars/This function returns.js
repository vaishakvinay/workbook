This function returns a different value depending on the parameter age.

Looks very complicated? Well, JS and Ruby also support the ternary operator and Python has something similar too:

condition ? statementa : statementb
Condition and statement separated by "?", different statement separated by ":" in both Ruby and JS; in Python you put the condition in the middle of two alternatives. The two examples above can be simplified with ternary operator:

function oddEven(n){
  return n%2 == 1 ? "odd number" : "even number";
}
function oldYoung(age){
  return age < 16 ? "children" : age < 50 ? "young man" : "old man";
}
