Build Tower
Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "*" character.

For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:

[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ", 
  "*****"
]
And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:

[
  "     *     ", 
  "    ***    ", 
  "   *****   ", 
  "  *******  ", 
  " ********* ", 
  "***********"
]

def tower_builder(n_floors):
    tower = []
    
    for i in range(n_floors):
        row = ''
        
        for j in range(n_floors - i - 1):
            row += ' '
        
        for j in range(2 * i + 1):
            row += '*'
        
        for j in range(n_floors - i - 1):
            row += ' '
        
        tower.append(row)
    
    return tower
